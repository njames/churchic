#App Design

#Introduction

This app ' Church InterChange ' or CIC or ChurchIC is to be a simple tool to sync data from one 
church it tool to another.

The initial impetus is to have 2 way sync betweeen CCB and PCO.
 
CCB is a system of record and church pastoring system
PCO is a planning / rostering system

While there is overlap is what both apps do there is enough value from both apps that many churches 
will run both for different purposes.

This leads to a problem of synchronisation.
 
Effectively there are now two systems of record. Creatives who interact mainly with PCO will 
tend to update their details via PCO because it is their touch point. 

Alternatively other changes to the database may come from phone calls or from manual contact 
 cards filled in in a service or even via updates made during the kids checking process.
 
The main way to keep data in sync is to choose one as the system of record (publisher) and the other data
sources as a subscriber of all changes to that system. The complexity is that in this case data
in the subscriber can update a record and have the most recent record. In this case this needs to 
be compared with the other source(s) and update via timestamps
 
Clashes where both systems change within the same timeperiod are problematic but can be dealt with manually.


Remember: Keep It Simple.


##Other Uses

1. Sync from CCB group to a mail software lists ( Mailchimp, contant contact, etc)
2. Provide metrics and a dashboard on KPI's
3. Send text's / SMS's 

## Why is this important

It's great to have good tools and best of breed tools that get the job done well.
No one system can do everything and nor should it. 

This system will provide the glue between so that manual work is removed and the system as a 
whole is more efficient. This enables staff and volunteers to be more effective at pastoring 
leading or being creative instead of admin or having to have extra people for tedious admin roles.
